# C Assignment

> Term ended and scores graded, it is safe to public the code. Normally assignments vary between terms, so hopefully I'm not violating the rules. 

This repo contains all C programming homework & project from jsl's class. For some reason, the actual git history is not suitable to public, that is it contains personal information. 

Note that the project (vsort) is **completely** written by me, for jsl didn't allow teamwork. 

To build these projects, you'd better have Dev-cpp installed under Windows. Or you might have a hard time fumbling with the generated Makefile. 

Enjoy!
